# 🌐 React Multi-Page Website with Login Authentication

A beautifully designed multi-page site built with **React Router DOM** that starts with a **Login Page**, then redirects to a navigable interface with **Home**, **About**, and **Contact** sections — each with their own **background images** for a visually appealing experience.

🎯 Project built as part of **Day 16** of my #100DaysOfReact challenge.
